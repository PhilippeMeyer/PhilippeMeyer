<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span lang="EN-US">App store for banks is nowadays becoming very fashionable and trendy. Bundling banks' services through an&nbsp;</span>API is either done by the bank itself (<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/04/02/bny-mellon-channels-silicon-valley-development-practices/">BNY for example</a>) or by fintechs connecting to different banks (<a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbankproject.com/">Open Bank Project</a>, .. just to name a few).</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><span lang="EN-US">But behind the hype, there are sound reasons for banks to develop in this direction. As banking is not the only industry making this move, there is already a bit of research backing this strategy.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span><span lang="EN-US">Banks have to face an ever increasing competition from fintechs. In that context, it is interesting to have a look at what has already been researched in the field of organic growth and innovation within large companies.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span lang="EN-US">Innovation normally occurs in a corporate model for established companies and in an entrepreneurship model for startups.

In order to more efficiently compete with new entrants, established players are looking at a mix of those two models called: ”corporate entrepreneurship” which is: “the process by which teams within an established company conceive, foster, launch and manage a new business that is distinct from the parent company but leverages the parent’s assets, market position, capabilities or other resources” </span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin; mso-field-lock:yes'></span>ADDIN CSL_CITATION { "citationItems" : [ { "id" : "ITEM-1", "itemData" : { "author" : [ { "dropping-particle" : "", "family" : "Wolcott", "given" : "Robert C.", "non-dropping-particle" : "", "parse-names" : false, "suffix" : "" }, { "dropping-particle" : "", "family" : "Lippitz", "given" : "Michael J.", "non-dropping-particle" : "", "parse-names" : false, "suffix" : "" } ], "container-title" : "MITSloan Management Review", "id" : "ITEM-1", "issue" : "49115", "issued" : { "date-parts" : [ [ "2007" ] ] }, "page" : "74-82", "title" : "The Four Models of Corporate Entrepreneurship", "type" : "article-journal", "volume" : "49" }, "uris" : [ "http://www.mendeley.com/documents/?uuid=f335d64d-8cab-4411-891b-67606d98185e" ] } ], "mendeley" : { "formattedCitation" : "(Wolcott & Lippitz, 2007)", "manualFormatting" : "(Wolcott & Lippitz, 2007 p75)", "plainTextFormattedCitation" : "(Wolcott & Lippitz, 2007)", "previouslyFormattedCitation" : "(Wolcott & Lippitz, 2007)" }, "properties" : { "noteIndex" : 0 }, "schema" : "https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json" }<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-models-of-corporate-entrepreneurship/">(Wolcott &amp; Lippitz, 2007)</a></span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang="EN-US">.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In this research, the authors identify four models to organize corporate entrepreneurship depending on two dimensions: <b>who</b>, within the organization, has <b>ownership </b>of new business creation and <b>who </b>is <b>funding </b>the needed resources:</span><o:p></o:p></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5-Y3TMLiZ6U/VgG19XWkPwI/AAAAAAAAooo/7MfoqOtqpW4/s1600/Intrapreneurship.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="317" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5-Y3TMLiZ6U/VgG19XWkPwI/AAAAAAAAooo/7MfoqOtqpW4/s400/Intrapreneurship.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><div class="MsoNormal">©<span style="text-align: start;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Wolcott &amp; Lippitz</span></span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">Enabler model&nbsp;</span></h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the “Enabler” model, the company needs to have a strong base of “<b>intrapreneurs</b>“ who are able and willing to build new ideas and products.

The combination of entrepreneurial activity with corporate ability seems like a perfect match, but can be elusive to achieve. This article examines how large corporations from the tech industry have begun to tap into entrepreneurial innovation from startups. Prominent examples are used to inductively derive a set of four models commonly used to engage with startups and to describe their characteristics, challenges, and rationales. While corporate equity is the key mechanism behind more established models, newer approaches replace equity with shared technology to connect both worlds with fewer organizational costs and greater speed and agility. This article presents a typology of corporate mechanisms to engage with startups that balance speed and agility against control and strategic direction, to map the ways companies can bridge the gap between themselves and the startup world. \u00a9 2015 by The Regents of the University of California.", "author" : [ { "dropping-particle" : "", "family" : "Weiblen", "given" : "T", "non-dropping-particle" : "", "parse-names" : false, "suffix" : "" }, { "dropping-particle" : "", "family" : "Chesbrough", "given" : "H W", "non-dropping-particle" : "", "parse-names" : false, "suffix" : "" } ], "container-title" : "California Management Review", "id" : "ITEM-1", "issue" : "July", "issued" : { "date-parts" : [ [ "2015" ] ] }, "page" : "66-90", "title" : "Engaging with startups to enhance corporate innovation", "type" : "article-journal", "volume" : "57" }, "uris" : [ "http://www.mendeley.com/documents/?uuid=c8e8c856-32f9-431e-af10-f7242f50ff9b" ] } ], "mendeley" : { "formattedCitation" : "(Weiblen & Chesbrough, 2015)", "plainTextFormattedCitation" : "(Weiblen & Chesbrough, 2015)", "previouslyFormattedCitation" : "(Weiblen & Chesbrough, 2015)" }, "properties" : { "noteIndex" : 0 }, "schema" : "https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json" }<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang="EN-US">(<a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/274137434_Engaging_with_Startups_to_Enhance_Corporate_Innovation">Weiblen &amp; Chesbrough</a>, 2015)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang="EN-US">. For this, they need to screen more than before those startups to identify sources of external knowledge. They also need to understand what they can bring to these startups and finally they need to be clear about their expectation from their collaboration with startups.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span><span lang="EN-US">Research </span><span lang="EN-US">is highlighting four possible models of interactions between large companies and startups:</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Venture capital</b>, taking a stake in a startup;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>In-out corporate incubation</b>, where the big corporate act as an incubator for its own ideas but not fitting the core business model;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Out-in corporate incubation</b> where big corporate identify some promising startups which they incubate;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Inside-out </b>platform where large companies setup a platform with their technology, welcoming startups to contribute in building a full ecosystem (Apple iPhone platform is one example of this approach).&nbsp;</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />The first two models involve capital sharing whereas the two others do not. A <b>capitalistic </b>relationship can be an issue for both parties: having a stake of a startup bought by a bank can help bringing resources and customers but it can also <b>limit </b>the startup’s <b>freedom to collaborate</b> with competitors. For the banks, it mobilizes capital and the negotiations are sometimes difficult regarding the price as there are numerous unknowns to valuate properly startups.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Exploring the two last models, the out-in model is pretty unlikely and limited considering the <b>very low R&amp;D efforts</b> within banks.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Inside-out model is the <b>clear trend</b> those days, where many banks are trying to present an <b>API </b>of their systems in order to develop an <b>eco system</b> on top of their services like Apple and Google did with their smartphone technologies. This approach is also fitting with the "Producer" intrapreneurship model which is quicker to implement for companies like banks that have no innovation culture.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />This analysis is <b>supporting </b>the trend seen in many organizations where a dedicated department ("<b>Producer</b>" model) is in charge of building an API and relationships with outsiders in order to build an eco system (<b>Inside-out platform</b>) and increase innovation grabbing knowledge from the startups banks interact with.</span></div>
