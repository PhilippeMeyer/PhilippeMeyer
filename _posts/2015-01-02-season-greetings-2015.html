At least in Europe, economical crisis is still around... As the evolution pace in the IT industry is not slowing down, companies are squeezed between limited resources and growing needs in the IT space. Optimizing is therefore quite high on the agenda.<br /><br />Hope that some of the ideas developed here will help in that matter...<br /><br />All the best for 2015 !
