Securities settlement&nbsp; is a rather cumbersome process coming from the old days when securities were still materialised. The whole process is still needing some days to complete (between 1 to 3) generating some credit risks in the meanwhile.<br /><br />Streamlining this process is therefore not only important from an efficiency view point but also from a credit risk perspective. If delivery versus payment is processed immediately,&nbsp; it will optimise the processing costs and reduce the credit risks.<br /><br />This is why Goldman Sachs put some efforts and investments in that mater which lead to issuing a <a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20150332395&amp;IDKey=59FBCC1DC1B7">patent</a> which has been recently validated.<br /><br />The idea here is to create a new currency called SETLcoin which will represent any kind of securities (called PIC in the patent). These new coins will be exchanged against other coins like bitcoin.<br /><br />The patent is describing a coordinator which will ensure the simultaneous completion of the two transaction legs (money against securities).<br /><br />This reinforces the view BNP Securities has shared in a <a href="http://securities.bnpparibas.com/files/live/sites/quintessence/files/Hot%20topics%20-%20marketing/Files/3909%20BP2S%20Bitcoin%20and%20Bloc-2.pdf">research</a> paper earlier this year, the securities industry is going to be severely impacted by the blockchain technology. In this paper, BNP presents two possible scenarios : a complete disruption where the market participants trade directly without any central body or a more conservative one where the established actors will embrace blockchain technology. <br /><br />This patent has been filled something like one year ago and demonstrates how much interest the established actors have for this technology.<br /><br />Goldman recently confirmed its forecast regarding the disruption blockchain will introduce, this <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/goldman-sachs-report/">post</a> also shows the amazing investments the blockchain technologies have attracted.
