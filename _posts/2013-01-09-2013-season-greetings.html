All the best to you all for 2013 !<br /><br />Crisis, especially in the capital markets, is here to stay which means that weÂ´ll have to deeply transform to survive. Instead of fearing these changes, one should consider this&nbsp;as exciting time ahead of us !<br /><br />Hope this blog will bring ideas to contribute a little to this process....<br />
