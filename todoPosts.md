## Pledging an NFT

Pledging an asset when it cannot be handed over to the creditor is rather costly. It has to involve a third party like for example a nortar.
Using the unique source of truth attribute of blockchain technology helps tremendously to solve efficiently this use case
For an NFT for example, it is trivial to block any transfer performed by the owner of a token if the token has been pledged. 
And only the creditor can remove the pledge

## Voting rights based on the time a stock has been hold

Some raiders spotting opportunities buy a lot of stocks before a GA to influence the decisions to their will. There is no easy way to prevent this behavior in the
traditional finance. Using a smart contract, it is trivial to correlate the voting power to the time the stock has been hold by the owner. With this comapnies
willing to favour long term investors have the proper tools implementing their desired policy in the smart contract.

## Stacking vs Dividends

curve is a good example of this type of arbitrage: the revenues genrerated by the curve transactions are distributed for 50% at the stakers and 50% to the holders 
of the coins. If not all the holders stake their coins, the ones staking will get more than the ones not staking their coins.
This creates an incitive for staking over dividends
